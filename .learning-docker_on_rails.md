Phew, lots of problems with this one

Tried following directions here: https://docs.docker.com/compose/rails/

Never could get it to work. Might try a new one just to see.

Eventually, I just created my rails project on localhost then used a simplified docker file that copied the data from my local project to the container. I followed the instructions on this page (https://medium.com/@guillaumeocculy/setting-up-rails-6-with-postgresql-webpack-on-docker-a51c1044f0e4) which worked great

Some things that tripped me up
-multiple images were getting into my docker install. For example, i had a ruby 2.7.1 image and a ruby 2.7.2 and the system defaulted to the ruby 2.7.1 image
-use the docker pull ruby:latest or ruby:[version] to get the right ruby version into docker (to match your gemfile and Dockerfile)

This page is kind of sarcastic/funny but includes some good "best practices" to use with docker files for Ruby. https://lipanski.com/posts/dockerfile-ruby-best-practices

This page is a much longer, more in depth version which contains a flexible argument based docker file: https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/ruby-on-whales-docker-for-ruby-rails-development

- Always specify version numbers of dependencies (e.g. ruby and any associated gems). Doing so allows you to upgrade in a more intentional, controlled manner
- Always create a .dockerignore file to avoid leaking any secrets. Does not honor the .gitignore file
- Group commands so that they aren't run every time which creates additional intermediate images/more space/more cpu required
- Places the commands that are the most likely to trigger an update (e.g. `copy src/`) at the bottom of the file because Docker will run anything after that
- Run commands and copy files as a non root user by adding as necessary and making sure to run chown to change the owner
- Don't include any secrets in your build file; clean up any injected secrets (e.g. from an Env var into a file) after using them (in the same command if possible)
- Use smaller base images when possible (e.g. ruby-alpine vs ruby)
- use multi-stage builds when building dependencies like nokogiri which pull in a bunch of other things to build but those things aren't needed for your app to run
- - ditto for any secrets needed to access a private repo or similar but which don't actually need to be in the image
- Prefer using the ["arg1","arg2","arg3"] format when executing commands which doesn't fork a new process vs `bundle exec rackup` which creates a new shell
- avoid installing test or development dependencies in your production builds
