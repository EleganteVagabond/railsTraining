# Rails Training
This repo contains files I have used in my quest to learn how to program in `Ruby on Rails`, more specifically the `Rails` part

I leveraged the [Oding Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-blog-app) in developing the blogger code. I did not fully complete the project but I was able to secure a `Rails` programming job (multiple offers) so I feel good about what I learned.

As with all of my `Training` repos, the notes I took on what I learned are stored in various `.learning-` files. Here you can see that I was also learning about Docker and Heroku during my journey.
